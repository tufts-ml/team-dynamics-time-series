The basketball data here is real data from the CLE_starters dataset.

* `continuous_states` has shape (T,J=10,D=2), where T is the number of timesteps, J is the number of entities (players), and D is the dimensionality of the observations (the normalized coordinates on the court).  The 0th player is Lebron James.
* `example_end_times` is a list of example end times. See code for documentation.
